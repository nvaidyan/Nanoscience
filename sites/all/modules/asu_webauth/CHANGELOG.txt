ASU Webauth Changelog


6.x-1.0, 2009-07-09
-------------------------
Version 1.0 Release
- Updated module so that any forced inclusions for webauth (e.g. admin, admin/*)
  are now properly passed to the webauth via the callapp parameter.
- fixed theme issue where the callapp parameter does not forward for any page (specified or not) 
  in Drupal 6.


6.x-1.0-dev, 2008-11-04
-------------------------
Porting to 6.x
- Manually included the user.pages.inc file to compensate for Drupal 6 
  streamlining the module loading and not loading this required inc file.

5.x-1.0-beta3, 2007-05-09

5.x-1.0-beta2, 2007-04-16
-------------------------
General
- New setting added to force all requests to /user to be redirected to 
  webauth.  Local login can still be accessed via /user?locallogin
- User roles are now updated on every login, to ensure webauth role gets set.
- Added optional setting to allow the user email field to be blank.
- Fixed issues where errors were reported upon user creation.
- Attempted to fix issue where module would think the user had an active 
  webauth session when they actually don't.  This needs to be tested and 
  verified.
- All settings are now stored in individual Drupal system variables, instead
  of being in one large array.
- General code cleanup
